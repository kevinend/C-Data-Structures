(1)Testing queue_enqueue:

(2)Testing queue_dequeue:

(3) Repopulating queue2
Queue1 count == 5, capacity == 8, head == 5
Queue2 count == 20, capacity == 20, head == 15

field1 == 0, field2 == 1, field3 == 2
field1 == 1, field2 == 2, field3 == 3
field1 == 2, field2 == 3, field3 == 4
field1 == 3, field2 == 4, field3 == 5
field1 == 4, field2 == 5, field3 == 6
(4) Checking count/capacity/head after populating and dequeing just a few elements from queue2: 
Queue1 count == 5, capacity == 8, head == 5
Queue2 count == 20, capacity == 20, head == 20

(5) shrink to size, where new_size is greater than count but less than capacity:
Queue1 count == 5, capacity == 8, head == 5
Queue2 count == 20, capacity == 20, head == 20

(6) shrink to size, where new_size is less than count but greater than head:
Queue1 count == 5, capacity == 8, head == 5
Queue2 count == 20, capacity == 20, head == 20

(7) shrink to size, where new_size is less than head:
Queue1 count == 5, capacity == 8, head == 5
Queue2 count == 2, capacity == 2, head == 2
